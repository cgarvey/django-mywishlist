My Wishlist
===========
A very basic Django web app to manage, and publish, your wishlist / present ideas. This app is designed to be run offline, and publishes static files (via Django management commands) that can be published online.

Installation
------------
You'll need to be familiar with Docker / Docker Compose. Files attached.

Contributing
------------
Pull requests happily considered!

If you can't contribute code, you can contribute Issues. Just be aware that this is a personal project, so time to resolve may be considerable!
